## ⚙️ What it does ⚙️

The REST API was built for Lecture Leverager at Fall Hacks 2021. Lecture Leverager is a web app that is designed to support students in an online/hybrid learning 
environment by turning their video lectures into notes using speech to text and offering text summerization of their lectures.  

The REST API is for accessing and using AssemblyAI as well as summerizing the response from AssemblyAI. 

main.py includes upload file, summerize, get text, get url and get transcription ID.
